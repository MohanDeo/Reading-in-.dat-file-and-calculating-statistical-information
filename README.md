# Reading-in-.dat-file-and-calculating-statistical-information
This C++ program reads in a .dat file of physics courses. It then determines the number of records in the file and calculates the mean and standard deviation of the marks. It also allows the user to print a list of courses for a particular year and sort the courses by title or course code.
